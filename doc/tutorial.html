<p>The timeline is at the bottom of the application window, and features several
tracks for both, video and audio data. To add a piece of footage simple drag the
desired file from the simple filemanager to the timeline. You can then position
it wherever you like. The same thing works for audio files too.</p>

<h2>Removing clips from the timeline</h2>

application window.</p>

<h2>Trimming clips</h2>

<p>
Trimming means removing parts of a clip that are at the the begining or and of a
video file. This can be easily done using the small arrows that are on the edges
of the clip. Grab one with the mouse and drag them to the preferred position. To
control what picture will be the cut the video view will display the video-frame
at that position.
</p>

<h2>Managing Projects</h2>

<p>
The Open Movie Editor uses a simple &quot;project management&quot; facility. To
name a project you just need to type in the name in the textbook on the left. A
new project can be started with the appropriate command in the &quot;Project&quot; menu.
All your project will be added to the project list on right of the menu bar.
Just select the one you want to work on, and it's loaded. In case you want to
duplicate a project, go to &quot;Save as...&quot; in the &quot;Project&quot; menu, you will then be
asked to enter a new name for the copy.

<h2>Crossfades</h2>

<p>If you want to create a crossfade, where two clips blend into each other
softly, you just drag them onto the same track such that they overlap. Than red
cross on blue background will appear like in the highlighted region in the
image.</p>

<h2>Audio Automations</h2>

quiet than other parts, or if you want to fade out some background music. Just
click on the automations tool button as marked in the image, and click onto an
audio clip to add automation points. You can drag them around with the mouse,
and if you drag on outside of the clip, it will disappear. Press shift while
adjusting to minipulate the volume for a whole area.</p>

button on it. This will pop up a context menu, where you can select "Mute
