<h1>Open Movie Editor Documentation</h1>

<p>Open Movie Editor is designed to be a simple tool, that provides basic movie
making capabilites. It aims to be powerful enough for the amateur movie artist,
yet easy to use.</p>

<p>This document describes version 0.1.0</p>

<h2>Adding video clips to the timeline</h2>

<p>The timeline is at the bottom of the application window, and features several
tracks for both, video and audio data. To add a piece of footage simple drag the
desired file from the simple filemanager to the timeline. You can then position
it wherever you like. The same thing works for audio files too.</p>

<h2>Removing clips from the timeline</h2>

application window.</p>

<h2>Trimming clips</h2>

<p>
Trimming means removing parts of a clip that are at the the begining or and of a
video file. This can be easily done using the small arrows that are on the edges
of the clip. Grab one with the mouse and drag them to the preferred position. To
control what picture will be the cut the video view will display the video-frame
at that position.
</p>

<h2>Managing Projects</h2>

<p>
The Open Movie Editor uses a simple &quot;project management&quot; facility. To
name a project you just need to type in the name in the textbook on the left. A
new project can be started with the appropriate command in the &quot;Project&quot; menu.
All your project will be added to the project list on right of the menu bar.
Just select the one you want to work on, and it's loaded. In case you want to
duplicate a project, go to &quot;Save as...&quot; in the &quot;Project&quot; menu, you will then be
asked to enter a new name for the copy.
</p>

<h2>Exporting to video files</h2>

<p>
Creating a new video file from the arrangement is called &quot;Rendering&quot;, it's also
available in the &quot;Project&quot; menu. You have to select a filename, video
and audio codecs, and there you go. The choices are limited at the moment, and
there will propably some simpler presets in the future.
