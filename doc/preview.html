<h1>Open Movie Editor Preview</h1>

<p>
This Document tries to outline the next Steps in the Development of the
<a href="http://openmovieeditor.sourceforge.net/">Open Movie Editor</a>. It
tries to be as accurate as possible, complete with mocked up screenshots.
</p>

<p>
So what's next? Although to current version is not ready for primetime yet, the
most basic primitives for doing a movie are already in place. You can place
clips on the timeline, add a little background music, trim clips, play back the
arrangement and render everything into a video file. Enough for simple usage. I think
this is a fairly nice approach, therefore I will keep it up and add some more
&quot;primitives&quot; before moving on to the fine tuning and refactoring.
</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>
There are some issues/problems that the current version as and that is mostly
the way the playback is handeled internally. It's based heavily on threads, and
since my experience is rather limited with this topic, the implementation is
poor. However I still feel that some other features are more relevant now, at
least until I can educate myself about alternatives or better patterns to deal
with this.
</p>

<h2>Fade Over</h2>

<p>
Besides a simple hard cut, I'm also planning to add the capability to provide a
soft fade over between clips. Although hard cuts are propably more
&quot;professional&quot; than anything else, a little soft cut here and there
can't be too bad. On a more technical side, adding this features means that I
have to implement a system to handle transparency between frames, which might be
interesting for other features in the future.
</p>

<p>
The user interface for this thingy will be as straight forward as possibly. To
fade two clips it will be enought to drag their ends into an overlap, which will
then be displayed as on the screenshot on the right.
</p>

<h2>Titel Maker</h2>

<p>
Whenever someone does a movie sooner or later the need to add some text will
surface, and therefore a simple title maker will be done, it propably won''t
have scrolling and animated text in it's first incarnation, but it will surely
be useful for a lot of stuff.
</p>

<p>
I anticipate to provide resizing and positiong by manipulating the text frame right in
the video view.
</p>

<h2>Volume Adjust</h2>

<p>
While the simple crossfade is propably sufficient for video, I think audio needs
some special attention. More often than not, a scene needs some quiet background
tunes that suddenly become more intense to support the plot. The most common
interface to model such functionality is the use of automations, or whatever
these might be called. It basically means little, draggable points on the track,
connected with lines that visualize the volume level at the different positions
of the sound.
