<h1>Open Movie Editor Preview</h1>

<p>This is the second edition of the <a href="http://openmovieeditor.sourceforge.net/">Open Movie Editor</a>, some things from the <a
href="preview.html">first edition</a> were successfully implemented, others have
been postponed, like the Title Maker. I refactored my ideas and shifted my
priorities, and this document will outline the proposed future direction.
</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>Well, I'm pretty satisfied with the current state, a lot of improvements have
been added over the last weeks, Fade Overs and Automation's are implemented, and
a lot of smaller bugs have been fixed.
</p>

<p>Some small issues remain, but these will be fixed eventually. I've dropped
the Title Maker for now, because essentially this job can be easily done in the
Gimp, and added as a transparent PNG.
</p>

<h2>RAM usage</h2>

<p>The biggest issue is probably that the usage of RAM as you add more
and more clips. While this is unavoidable as the whole composite has to be kept
in memory, I'm referring to the Thumbnails and Waveforms in the Time line, as
these might get out of control in bigger movies.
</p>

<p>It works surprisingly well, even with big files, but something needs to be
done, to ensure scalability.
</p>

<p>Therefore the plan is to cache the thumbnails to disk, and keep only a cache
of limited size in the memory. This will also improve the start up time of the
application, as this disk-cache will remain on the hard disk to be reused on the
next application start up.
</p>

<p>The same thing will be done for the audio waveforms, which need to be kept in
different resolutions, to make up for different zoom factors. This should
provide a really responsive interface even when dealing with lots of large
files.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>A primary goal of OpenME is to be fast, really fast. Most of the RAM
optimizations proposed above, will also result in a blazing performance,
especially when you consider application start up time. The current version
actually keeps very responsive while generating thumbnails and waveforms due to
the use if "idle handlers". This means the data is generated in the background,
while the interface remains fully usable.
</p>

<p>
At the moment the internal representation of the time line is handled as a bunch
of linked lists, because this is the simplest approach and it works very well,
however it could be that when people create absurdly huge projects this will be
a bottleneck. If this proves to be the case, I will definitely check out whether
something like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure">Tree
data structure</a> could be used to work around any limitations.
</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>
With the introduction of ffmpeg into OpenME, a whole bunch of file formats is
suddenly supported, provided it has the appropriate framerate and samplerate. I
choose to standardize on 25fps (PAL) and 48000Hz, unfortunately, sometimes files
exist with different resolutions.
</p>

<p>Handling different samplerates on the fly is no problem, although it is a
performance and quality trade off. It might also have some implications when
trying to keep audio and video in sync, which might get tricky anyways.
</p>
<h2>User Interface</h2>

<p>
On thing that might be annoying in real usage is the lack of preview thumbnails
in the file browser. This has been a low priority, because up to now more
important pieces were missing, however as the current state is quite acceptable,
I'm looking forward to enhance the file browser as well.
</p>

<p>
I think a convenient way to browse files and directories might be two separate
views, that could be arranged and resized as the user prefers.
